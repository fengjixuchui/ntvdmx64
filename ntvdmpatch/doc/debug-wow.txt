Debugging WOW applications
==========================

ntsd contains a useful extension for debugging WOW problems.
Although you can of course debug the ntvdm using yoda, some specific WOW
commands may become handy for i.e. finding exceptions.
This requires some preparation first:

1) Install debug symbols for NTVDM and NTVDMD so that WinDBG can find the
   required symbols:

   copy Binaries\x86chk\Symbols\retail\exe\ntvdm.pdb %systemroot%\SysWOW64\
   copy Binaries\x86chk\Symbols\retail\dll\ntvdmd.pdb %systemroot%\SysWOW64\

2) Install x86 Debugging Tools for Windows (Windbg), if you haven't yet.
   Can be found in GRMWDK_EN_7600_1.ISO that you downloaded to build NTVDMx64
   in directory Debuggers\dbg_x86.msi

   Ensure that you install Debugging tools for Windows into a short path,
   as it updates PATH environment variable upon execution to its long path
   name and this can confuse/crash DOS/WOW16 applications

   So i.e. I installed it to c:\WINDBG


3) Windbg contains vmdexts.dll extension, however, it's compiled for i386 and
   not for CCPU-Build, therefore you need to use ntvdmx64 version of the 
   extension:

   mkdir c:\WINDBG\vdm
   copy Binaries\x86chk\dbg\files\bin\winxp\vdmexts.dll c:\WINDBG\vdm\

4) Upon debugging, you need to load the correct extension, so you need to
   specify with pathname:

   !vdm\vdmexts.load

5) Now you can use the extension, i.e. enable break on first chance exception:
   !vdm\vdmexts.sxe ex

   Enable break on each module load:
   !vdm\vdmexts.sxe cw
